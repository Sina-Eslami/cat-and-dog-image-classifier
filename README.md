Dog/Cat Classifier Project:

This repository contains the second project of the FreeCodeCamp Machine Learning curriculum: Dog/Cat Classifier. The goal of this project is to classify images as either dogs or cats using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

Overview
Average Accuracy: 74%
Training Time: Barely 3 minutes per epoch
Test Requirements:
Minimum accuracy to pass: 63%
Extra credit for accuracy above 70%
The project was completed without altering the recommended number of epochs, ensuring fast and efficient execution.

Key Features
Image Augmentation
The project explores image augmentation to improve accuracy. Key findings:

Adding features like horizontal_rotation didn’t improve results.
A wider rotation_range significantly boosted accuracy.
Google Colab vs. Jupyter Notebook
Although the default starter code is on Google Colab, I strongly recommend testing your approaches locally on Jupyter Notebook:

Faster execution, even compared to Google Colab’s GPU runtime.
Greater flexibility for debugging and experimentation.
